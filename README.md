# Method of Characteristics

These functions and example scripts implement and demonstrate the method of characteristics for a general nonlinear first-order PDE in two spatial dimensions. This code uses the Symbolic Maths* toolbox in MATLAB to solve [Charpit's Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_characteristics#Fully_nonlinear_case). Therefore, we're limited by MATLAB's ability to solve coupled systems of ODEs.

There's a few example scripts that demonstrate how this method can be used to solve a few common eqations. These examples inculde the Eikonal equation representing granular piles of granular material and nonlinear waves.

_*_ MATLAB refer to this as the Symbolic Math toolbox because they're wrong.
